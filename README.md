# Song Title: Taking a Walk

"Taking a Walk" is a piece meant for those wanting to relax to a catchy song, whether it's on walk, or while doing homework, or during any other activity. The 808s, snares, and cymbals all work together to produce a catchy rhythm, one you might rock your head too (at least I know I did). Combined with a simple yet soothing melody, and the sound of waves crashing which adds a meditative feel, this song will put you in an nice, upbeat mood, prepared to tackle what's ahead. Hope you enjoy!
